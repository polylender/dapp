    question: 'How do I start lending on Polylender?',
    answer:
      'To start lending on Polylender, first connect your wallet using the "Connect Wallet" button. Then, navigate to the Market page where you can see available lending opportunities. Choose a loan that matches your risk profile and click "Lend" to provide liquidity.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the risks involved in lending?',
    answer:
      'The main risks in lending include borrower default, smart contract vulnerabilities, and market volatility. We mitigate these risks through collateral requirements, smart contract audits, and automated liquidation mechanisms. Always do your own research and never lend more than you can afford to lose.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I borrow funds?',
    answer:
      'To borrow funds, you need to provide collateral in the form of supported cryptocurrencies. Navigate to the Borrow page, select the amount you want to borrow, provide the required collateral, and accept the terms. Your loan will be processed once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain.',
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I can't repay my loan?",
    answer:
      'If you cannot repay your loan, the collateral you provided will be liquidated to cover the debt. This is an automated process that occurs when the value of your collateral falls below the liquidation threshold. To avoid liquidation, you can either repay the loan or add more collateral.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How are interest rates determined?',
    answer:
      'Interest rates are determined by market forces, including supply and demand for loans, collateral type, and loan duration. Rates are dynamic and can change based on market conditions. You can view current rates on the Market page.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What cryptocurrencies are supported?',
    answer:
      'Polylender currently supports major cryptocurrencies including ETH, USDC, and other ERC-20 tokens. The list of supported assets is regularly updated based on market demand and security considerations. Check the Market page for the most up-to-date list.',
